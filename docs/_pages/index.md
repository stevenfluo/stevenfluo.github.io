I am a 4th-year undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley double majoring in [Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/cs/) and [Data Science](https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/data-science-undergraduate-studies/data-science-major) with a minor in [Public Policy](https://gspp.berkeley.edu). My research interests broadly lie in computer vision, autonomous systems and robotics, deep learning, and technology/AI policy, and I hope to pursue a PhD in Computer Science after graduation. I currently research drone autonomy in the Video and Image Processing Lab with Professor Avideh Zakhor. I am also building the [Tech Policy Initiative](https://citris-uc.org/research/citris-tech-policy/) at CITRIS and the Banatao Institute, and will be on course staff for CS 189/289A: Introduction to Machine Learning in the fall.

This summer, I will be continuing my work on research projects in Berkeley. Last summer, I was a Software Engineering Intern at VitalSense through the CITRIS Workforce Innovation Program, and spent the rest of my time as a Congressional Affairs and Policy Planning Intern at the Defense Innovation Unit of the U.S. Department of Defense. Previously, I was a Robust Software Engineering intern at NASA Ames Research Center's Intelligent Systems Division where I worked on improving the simulation-to-reality transfer learning accuracy of deep neural network classifiers. Before that, I investigated the surprise adequacy scores of deep learning systems at NASA Langley Research Center. Check out my other projects [here](https://stevenfluo.github.io/projects).

I'm grateful to be supported by the [Regents' and Chancellor's Scholarship](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/types-of-aid-at-berkeley/scholarships/regents-and-chancellors-scholarship/) and Cal Alumni Association's [Leadership Award](https://alumni.berkeley.edu/get-involved/scholarships/the-leadership-award/). I am also a [Data Scholar](https://data.berkeley.edu/data-science/student-opportunities/data-scholars) and part of the [STEM Excellence through Equity and Diversity (SEED) Scholars Honors Program](https://seedscholars.berkeley.edu/home).

In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy teaching (especially CS education and science communication), reading, cooking, as well as watching the symphony and opera. I'm also a student in the UC Berkeley carillon program and a member of the [Berkeley Carillon Guild](https://bells.studentorg.berkeley.edu). This year, I'm challenging myself to read one book every month (with occasional accompanying blogs). Have titles to suggest or thoughts to share? Feel free to reach out ‚Äî I'd love to hear from you!

If you would like to contact me, you can email me at sfluo (AT@) berkeley (DOT.) edu. Thanks for stopping by!
