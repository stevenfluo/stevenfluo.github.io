I am a 3rd-year undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley double majoring in [Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/cs/) and [Data Science](https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/data-science-undergraduate-studies/data-science-major) while pursuing a minor in [Public Policy](https://gspp.berkeley.edu). My research interests broadly lie in machine learning, computer vision, technology/AI policy, and computer ethics, and I hope to pursue a PhD in Computer Science after graduation.

This summer, I was a Software Engineering Intern at VitalSense through the CITRIS Workforce Innovation Program, and spent the rest of my time as a Congressional Affairs and Policy Planning Intern at the Defense Innovation Unit. Previously, I was a Robust Software Engineering intern at NASA Ames Research Center's Intelligent Systems Division where I worked on improving the simulation-to-reality transfer learning accuracy of deep neural network classifiers. Before that, I investigated the surprise adequacy scores of deep learning systems at NASA Langley Research Center.

I'm grateful to be supported by the [Regents' and Chancellor's Scholarship](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/types-of-aid-at-berkeley/scholarships/regents-and-chancellors-scholarship/) and Cal Alumni Association's [Leadership Award](https://alumni.berkeley.edu/get-involved/scholarships/the-leadership-award/). I am also a [Data Scholar](https://data.berkeley.edu/data-science/student-opportunities/data-scholars) and part of the [STEM Excellence through Equity and Diversity (SEED) Scholars Honors Program](https://seedscholars.berkeley.edu/home).

In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy teaching (especially CS education and science communication), reading, cooking, as well as watching the symphony and opera.

If you would like to contact me, you can email me at sf[my last name] (AT) berkeley (DOT) edu. Thanks for stopping by!
