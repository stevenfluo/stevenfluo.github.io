I am a 2nd-year undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley double majoring in [Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/cs/) and [Data Science](https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/data-science-undergraduate-studies/data-science-major) in the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society while pursuing a minor in [Public Policy](https://gspp.berkeley.edu) in the Goldman School. My research interests broadly lie in machine learning, computer vision, technology policy, and computer ethics, and I hope to pursue a PhD in Computer Science after graduation.

This summer, I was a Robust Software Engineering intern in NASA Ames Research Center's Intelligent Systems Division where I worked on improving the simulation-to-reality transfer learning accuracy of deep neural network classifiers. Previously, I investigated the surprise adequacy scores of deep learning systems at NASA Langley Research Center. I also have worked on several research projects through Berkeley's Data Discovery and Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship Programs, including a current project with [Chesa Boudin](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/our-faculty/faculty-profiles/chesa-boudin/#tab_profile). 

I'm grateful to be supported by the [Regents' and Chancellor's Scholarship](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/types-of-aid-at-berkeley/scholarships/regents-and-chancellors-scholarship/) and Cal Alumni Association's [Leadership Award](https://alumni.berkeley.edu/get-involved/scholarships/the-leadership-award/). I am also a [Data Scholar](https://data.berkeley.edu/data-science/student-opportunities/data-scholars) and part of the [STEM Excellence through Equity and Diversity (SEED) Scholars Honors Program](https://seedscholars.berkeley.edu/home).

In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy teaching (especially CS education and science communication), reading, cooking, as well as watching the symphony and opera.

If you would like to contact me, you can email me at sf[my last name] (AT) berkeley (DOT) edu. Thanks for stopping by!
